NucShapeNet Trial 1 — 10-Fold Cross Validation

Overview
- Task: Nucleosome vs Linker classification (D. melanogaster)
- Pipeline: MLSNet-based model with 3-mer one-hot sequence (12x145) + 5 DNA shape features (5x147)
- Validation: Stratified 10-fold cross validation with per-fold internal hold-out for validation

Hyperparameters
- Folds (k): 10
- Batch size: 64 (drop_last=True for training loader)
- Epochs (max): 15
- Early stopping: patience=5 (on validation loss)
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-4)
- Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau (patience=5) on validation loss
- Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
- Evaluation threshold: 0.5
- Model specifics:
  - Sequence branch kernels: 3x3, 7x7, 11x11; channels fused
  - Shape branch attention (STVit)
  - Shape LSTM input size: 65 after conv+pool; bidirectional; dropout=0.2
  - Sequence LSTM hidden size: 256; dropout=0.2
  - Adaptive pooling aligns shape/sequence widths before concatenation

Epoch Losses
- Note: Per-epoch Train and Val losses were printed to terminal but not persisted. To capture them automatically next runs, run:
  PowerShell: python train.py | Tee-Object -FilePath "Finetuning Documentations/trial1_10_folds/train_log.txt"
  Or add a CSV logger in Trainer to write {fold,epoch,train_loss,val_loss}.
- For this trial, please paste terminal loss logs into train_log.txt to complete this section.
